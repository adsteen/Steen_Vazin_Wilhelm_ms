Steen_Vazin_Wilhelm_ms
======================

Code and data used to produce the Steen, Vazin and Wilhelm manuscript about peptidase substrate specificity

The only user-facing function is `write_paper(path="", print_plots=TRUE, save_plots=TRUE)`. This in turn loads all relevant data and prints or saves plots and tables to `path`. 

Raw datasets are <<need to set these up>>.
